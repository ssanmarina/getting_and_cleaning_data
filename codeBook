# R script (run_analysis.R): 
# 1. Merge train (train/X_train.txt) and test set (test/X_test.txt)
# 2. Extract mean and standard deviation for individual measurements.  

# Reads activity_labels.txt and applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set: 
walking 
walkingupstairs 
walkingdownstairs 
sitting 
standing 
laying 

* The scriptlabels the data set : all feature names (attributes) and activity names are converted to lower case, underscores 
* and brackets () are removed. Then it merges the 10299x66 data frame containing features with 10299x1 data frames containing 
* activity labels and subject IDs. The result is saved as merged_clean_data.txt, a 10299x68 data frame such that the first 
* column contains subject IDs, the second column activity names, and the last 66 columns are measurements. 
* Subject IDs are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive. The names of the attributes are similar to the following: 
tbodyacc-mean-x  
tbodyacc-mean-y  
tbodyacc-mean-z  
tbodyacc-std-x  
tbodyacc-std-y  
tbodyacc-std-z  
tgravityacc-mean-x  
tgravityacc-mean-y 

* Finally, the script creates a 2nd, independent tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity and 
* each subject. The result is saved as data_set_with_the_averages.txt, a 180x68 data frame, where as before, the first 
* column contains subject IDs, the second column contains activity names (see below), and then the averages for each of the 
* 66 attributes are in columns 3...68. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus 180 rows in this data set with averages.
